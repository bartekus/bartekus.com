# Pension.you, briefly

I'm building a private pension platform that combines retirement savings with life insurance. Here's why, and what makes it different.

## The problem

Most Canadians don't have workplace pensions. They're left with:
- RRSPs (if they remember to contribute)
- TFSAs (if they have extra cash)
- CPP (not enough to live on)

Life insurance is separate. Often overlooked until it's needed.

Result? People under-save for retirement and under-insure their families.

## The insight

What if your pension contributions automatically included life insurance coverage?

You're already saving for the future. Why not protect your family at the same time?

## How it works

**Simple contribution model:**
- You contribute monthly (like any pension)
- Funds go into two pools:
  - 85% → Investment portfolio
  - 15% → Life insurance premiums

**Transparent investments:**
- Low-fee index funds
- Clear asset allocation
- No hidden management fees
- Annual statements in plain language

**Life insurance integration:**
- Coverage scales with your contributions
- No separate underwriting process
- Competitive group rates
- Death benefit protects your family

## Why transparency matters

Traditional financial products hide complexity:
- Fees buried in fine print
- Investment returns obscured
- Insurance terms confusing
- No clear view of where money goes

**Pension.you shows everything:**
- Exact fee breakdown (what you pay, what it covers)
- Investment performance vs. benchmarks
- Insurance costs and coverage amounts
- Projected retirement income

No surprises. No jargon. Just clarity.

## Fraud resistance

Financial products attract fraud. We're designing for that:
- Identity verification via OIDC and SSI
- Transaction monitoring for anomalies
- Automated compliance checks
- Clear audit trails
- Regulatory reporting built in

Security isn't bolted on—it's foundational.

## Regulatory compliance

Private pensions in Canada require:
- Registration with CRA
- Annual reporting to regulators
- Actuarial reviews
- Member disclosures
- Strict investment limits

We're automating compliance from day one. Less risk, less overhead, more time building product.

## Current status

Pension.you is in active development:
- Core architecture defined
- Identity verification flows designed
- Compliance automation in progress
- Insurance integrations planned
- MVP targeted for Q2 2025

## Why now?

Interest rates are normalizing. Market volatility reminds people they need retirement plans. Life insurance is no longer an afterthought.

People want simple, transparent financial products that don't require a finance degree to understand.

## What's next

Over the next few months:
- Finalize insurance partnerships
- Complete regulatory filings
- Build member dashboard
- Launch private beta

I'll write more about the technical and compliance challenges as we solve them. Follow along on the [blog](/writing) or [reach out](/contact) if you want to learn more.
